<b>Rules to check before opening a pull request</b>

---

- A relevant bit of code must be included in the file.
- To avoid duplication, go via the Pull Requests Section.
- Each pull request **MUST ONLY** contain **ONE ENTRY**.
- Put the files in the appropriate programming language directories. If no folder exists, make one.
- Provide good documentation for each file so that novices may comprehend it.
- Give a short descriptive commit title. Eg. `Updated File` :x:, `Added palindrome in Python` :heavy_check_mark:
- Pull requests must have a descriptive title that is comparable.

That's all! Allow for the review and merging of the PR into the repository.
